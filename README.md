# Journey
The app 'Journey' is about establishing a link between all the posts that an average makes on the social networks and aggregating them into journeys.
The aim of the application is to collect posts made by the user on various social networks and then allowing the user to classify them under one Journey.

The assumption in designing the app is that the posts users make can viewed as memories. Thus, what this app aims to do is to do
